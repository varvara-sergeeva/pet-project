# React App

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

My first React app.
Learning React.

Main idea:
Create an application where a user can donate funds for food to an animal without an owner. The application is exclusively mobile.

Includes multiple pages.
The main page with a list of animals, search with filtering.
A page with pets that the person has tagged and added to the list.
Page with the history of donations.
Chat page. When a person makes a donation, after that, an employee contacts him in a chat, then attaches a photo of the check and the pet that received care for the user's money.
Page with a form for payment.
Page with profile settings.
Registration and login page.
